# The-4-queen-s-Problem
The 4-Queen Problem is a classic puzzle in the field of combinatorial optimization. It's a smaller version of the famous N-Queen Problem, where the goal is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. In this case, we are working with a 4×4 board and four queens.
